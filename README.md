# The WoFlow Challenge

This is an engineering challenge I answered for WoFlow in November of 2022 as an interview question.

This code traverses a node tree they have on a herokuapp.

The challenge posed two questions:
1) How many unique Ids are there, and
2) What's the most commonly seen one?

It found there are **30 unique node ids**, and the most common one was **a06c90bf-e635-4812-992e-f7b1e2408a3f**.
